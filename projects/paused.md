[impedito](https://github.com/meh/impedito)
-------------------------------------------
impedito is an MPD player that takes a slightly different approach to
things.

It aims to copy MOC's interface and functionality while using MPD as
backend.

Windows are scriptable in Ruby and it will supports all functionality
that is supported by other MPD clients.

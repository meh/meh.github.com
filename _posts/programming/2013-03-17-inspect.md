From the previous post about stringifying things, comes [inspect][1], it's an
improved version of stringify and actually returns inspecting strings like Ruby
does, so it's not for stringifying, you should use an internal standard for
that and use the appropriate methods and functions.

If you really want to just stringify things you can easily adapt inspect to do
your biddings, it's WTFPL: do what the fuck you want with it.

It works on Clang, GCC and \*gasp\* MSVC.

Active projects are projects that are still actively and heavily developed.

Paused projects are projects I have stopped working on momentarily but will become
active again sooner or later.

Working projects are projects that I see as fine as they are, if anyone finds bugs or
has some nice ideas for additions they will become active again.

Dropped projects are projects I don't give a fuck about anymore.
